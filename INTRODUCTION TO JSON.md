### JSON

**INTRODUCTION TO JSON**
JSON stands for **JavaScript Object Notation**. JavaScript Object Notation is a schema-less, text-based representation of structured data that is based on key-value pairs and ordered lists. Although JSON is derived from JavaScript, it is supported either natively or through libraries in most major programming languages.
JSON is a generic data format with a minimal number of value types: strings, numbers, booleans, lists, objects, and null. Although the notation is a subset of JavaScript.

**Why Should we use JSON?** 
However it has become portable and is used in other languages too. The JSON format is often used for serializing and transmitting structured data over a network connection. It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application, serving as an alternative to XML.

**Why is JSON Important ?**
JavaScript makes it Very Smooth and easy to use, and due to the Simplicity that presents- the Parsing of JSON is easier to implement and therefore less prone to errors than a XML Implementation.

**LIMITATIONS OF JSON**
1. No schema. On the one hand, that means you have total flexibility to represent the data in any way you want. On the other, it means you could accidentally create misshapen data very easily.

2.No date type. This omission means developers must resort to using string representations of dates, leading to formatting discrepancies, or must represent dates in the form of milliseconds since the epoch (January 1, 1970).

3. No comments. This makes it impossible to annotate fields inline, requiring additional documentation and increasing the likelihood of misunderstanding.
 
**JSON SYNTAX RULES:**
JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript Object Notation syntax:

- Data is in name/value pairs.
- Data is separated by commas.
- Curly braces hold objects.
- Square brackets hold arrays.
