### DOM ( Document Object Model)

When a Web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.

**What is DOM ?**

The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) Standard.
"The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language neutral interface that allows  programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, & style of a document".

The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:
- Core DOM    - Standard model for all document types.
- XML DOM     - Standard model for XML documents.
- HTML DOM  - Standard model for HTML documents.


### HTML DOM Methods

The important methods of document object are as follows:
